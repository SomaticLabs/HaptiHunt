A simple game to demonstrate the potential for haptic guidance in VR, using [Zorb Touch](https://zorbtouch.com). 

Made for any Google Cardboard or Google Daydream headset, this demo is a treasure hunt where the user is guided with haptic effects to look for randomly generated cubes in their 3D environment.
